### 1. **Flask App Structure**

- **App Initialization**: Set up your Flask application, organizing it into models, views (or routes), and services for better separation of concerns.

- **Database Models**: Define SQLAlchemy models for both the simplified Anki database information and your general vocabulary database. These models will facilitate storing, querying, and updating vocab words and related Anki card information.

- **Services Layer**: Implement a services layer that handles business logic, such as processing vocab words, interacting with the AnkiConnect API, and managing database operations. This layer abstracts the complexity of these operations from your Flask routes.

- **API Routes**: Define Flask routes that expose endpoints for adding vocab words, generating Anki cards, and querying your vocab database. These routes will act as the interface between your Flask app and external clients or services.

### 2. **Abstracting AnkiConnect API**

- **Wrapper Functions**: Create wrapper functions around the AnkiConnect API calls. These functions will be responsible for sending requests to AnkiConnect and handling responses. This abstraction allows for easier maintenance and updates if the AnkiConnect API changes.

- **Anki Card Generation**: Implement functionality to convert vocab words into the format required by Anki (e.g., creating note objects with fields for the word, its meaning, example sentences, etc.) and use your AnkiConnect wrapper to add these as notes/cards in Anki.

### 3. **Managing the Vocab Database**

- **Vocab Word Addition**: Provide endpoints for adding new vocab words to your database. This could include detailed information about the word, its source (e.g., book title, author), and example sentences.

- **Vocab Querying and Updating**: Offer endpoints for querying existing vocab words (e.g., searching by word, listing all words) and updating their information (e.g., adding new example sentences, updating meanings).

### 4. **Integrating External Vocab Sources**

- **API Endpoints**: Create API endpoints that external services can call to add vocab words to your database. These endpoints could accept data in a standardized format, process it, and store it in your vocab database.

- **Real-time Highlighting**: For services that offer real-time highlighting of unknown vocab words, consider implementing websockets or long-polling in your Flask app to support real-time updates.

### 5. **Flask Application Example**

Here's a very basic structure of what the Flask app file structure might look like:

```
/anki_vocab_flask_app
    /app
        __init__.py
        /models
            __init__.py
            models.py
        /services
            __init__.py
            anki_services.py
            vocab_services.py
        /routes
            __init__.py
            api.py
    /migrations
    /tests
    config.py
    run.py
```

And a simple example of a Flask route in `api.py`:

```python
from flask import Blueprint, request, jsonify
from app.services.vocab_services import add_vocab_word

api_blueprint = Blueprint('api', __name__, url_prefix='/api')

@api_blueprint.route('/vocab', methods=['POST'])
def add_vocab():
    data = request.json
    word = data.get('word')
    usage = data.get('usage')
    # Call a service function to process and add the vocab word
    add_vocab_word(word, usage)
    return jsonify({"message": "Vocab word added successfully"}), 201
```

### 6. **Conclusion**

Your Flask app will serve as a powerful interface between various vocab word sources and Anki, streamlining the process of vocab learning and review. Itâ€™s scalable, allowing for the addition of new vocab sources and functionalities over time, and provides a centralized API for managing vocab words and generating Anki cards.
